# PinupMobile
Mobile frontend for the Remote Control of PinupPopper

This is a super basic mobile app to interact with the web api created by Nailbuster in PinupPopper.

If you don't know what PinupPopper is then this project will be no use to you! 

You also have to ensure you've followed all the steps with setting up the Web Remote feature of Pinup explained here http://www.nailbuster.com/wikipinup/doku.php?id=web_remote_control

Soon(ish) I'll be getting a copy of both the Android and iOS apps up onto their respective app stores for free so people can grab copied and use it with their VPinCab.

Here's some screenshots with general feature list...
